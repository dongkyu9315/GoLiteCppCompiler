    • The paragraph on type expressions ends abruptly; did you forget to
      finish it?
    • I would have liked to know who worked on the scanner, the parser,
      the AST, etc.  Even just a rough idea.
    • You did not explain your choice of Java and SableCC

  • Before submitting, make sure to disable the debugging print
    statements (e.g. "Scanning…", "Parsing…") as those make it harder to
    automate counting how many programs you compiler successfully
    processed.
  • For the invalid programs, I removed the ones containing the strings
    "weed", "blank", "continue" and "break".
