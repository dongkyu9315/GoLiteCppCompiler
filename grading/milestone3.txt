• Good and detailed explanation for the choice of C++.
• How did you handle type aliases?  Your first point in "design
  decisions" seems to imply both; I imagine you forgot to insert the
  word "not" somewhere.
• Forward function declaration is not necessary since we don't allow
  that in GoLite.
• Very, *very* good report: short, clear, precise and to the point.
  Keep it up guys!
• Tip: did you guys consider that a malicious Go program could use
  variable names that are not keywords in Go, but are in C++?  E.g. var
  typedef int = 3;
